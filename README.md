This file contains the high-impact variants identified from whole-genome sequencing data after variant calling and filtering, and annotated using SnpEff to predict their potential functional effects. The high_impact_variants.vcf file contains all high-impact variants annotated with SnpEff, while high_impact_table.txt  contains extracted key fields (CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, IMPACT, EFFECT, GENE) for easy reference.
